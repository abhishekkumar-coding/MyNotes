---

### üß† Key Points:

- Messages are typically HTTP **requests** sent by the client and HTTP **responses** returned by the server.
- Each message carries **resource representations** (usually in JSON or XML).
- Messaging is **stateless**, meaning each message is independent.
- It enables **communication and data transfer** following REST principles.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Messaging in RESTful services is the process of sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses to interact with resources.

## ‚ùì 6. Explain ‚ÄòAddressing‚Äô in RESTful Web Services

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**Addressing** in RESTful web services refers to the way **resources are uniquely identified** using **URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)** or URLs.

---

### üß† Key Points:

- Every resource (data or service) has a **unique URI**.
- URIs are used by clients to **access and manipulate resources**.
- The structure of URIs should be **meaningful and hierarchical** (e.g., `/users/123`, `/products/456`).
- Proper addressing makes APIs intuitive and easy to navigate.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

Addressing is how RESTful services identify and locate resources uniquely using URLs.


## ‚ùì 7. Why Are REST Services Easily Scalable?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

REST services are easily scalable because they follow **statelessness** and **client-server architecture** principles.

---

### üß† Key Reasons:
