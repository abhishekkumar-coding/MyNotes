## Different Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types (immutable, stored by value)

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (mutable, stored by reference)

## Primitive
Number	Represents integers & floating-point numbers	let x = 10;
String	Represents a sequence of characters	let name = "John";
Boolean	Represents true or false values	let isActive = true;
BigInt	Used for very large integers	let bigNum = 1234567890123456789n;
Symbol	Unique & immutable identifier (mostly for object properties)	let sym = Symbol("id");
Undefined	A variable declared but not assigned a value	let x;
Null	Represents an intentional absence of value	let y = null;

## Non-Primitive

Object	Collection of key-value pairs	let user = { name: "John", age: 25 };
Array	Ordered list of values	let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
Function	A block of reusable code	function greet() { return "Hello"; }
