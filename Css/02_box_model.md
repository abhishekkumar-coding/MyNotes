## Box Model in CSS

The CSS Box Model defines how elements are structured and spaced on a webpage. Every HTML element is considered as a rectangular box, consisting of the following layers:

Content – The actual text, image, or other content inside the element.

Padding – Space between the content and the border.

Border – A line surrounding the padding and content.

Margin – Space outside the border, separating the element from others.

## Box Sizing: content-box vs border-box
By default, browsers use the content-box model, where width and height apply only to the content.

content-box (Default) → Width excludes padding & border.

border-box → Width includes padding & border.
