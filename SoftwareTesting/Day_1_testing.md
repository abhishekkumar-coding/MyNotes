### What is software testing?
Software testing is a process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding any errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.

### What is the difference between software testing and debugging?
Software testing is a process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding any errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.
Debugging is a process of finding and fixing errors in a program or application.

### What is the difference between software testing and quality assurance?
Software testing is a process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding any errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.
Quality assurance is a process of ensuring that the software meets the requirements and is of high quality.

### How many types of software testing are there?
There are two types of software testing:
1. Manual Testing
2. Automation Testing

### What is manual testing?
Manual software testing is the process of manually checking software for bugs, defects, or issues without using any automation tools. A human tester plays the role of an end user and tests all the features of the application by clicking, typing, and navigating through the app to ensure it behaves as expected.

🔍 Key Features of Manual Testing:
✅ No automation tools – Testing is done by hand.

✅ Exploratory – Testers use their intuition and experience.

✅ UI/UX checks – Helps evaluate user experience directly.

✅ Test cases – Testers write and execute predefined test cases manually.

✅ Real-world behavior – Helps understand how a real user might use the system.

## 🧪 Common Types of Manual Testing:
- Smoke Testing – Basic checks to see if the app runs at all.
- Functional Testing – Verifies if specific features work as expected.
- Regression Testing – Ensures new changes haven’t broken existing features.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Done from the end-user perspective.
- Exploratory Testing – Testers explore the app without a script.
