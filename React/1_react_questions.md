### 1. What problem is React solving?

Earlier, when doing web development, in order to remove, add, or change an element on the page, the entire page had to be re-rendered. This massively impacted the application‚Äôs performance, slowing down and degrading the user experience. That is where React came into the picture. With the concept of its virtual DOM, now, whenever there is a change, only a part of the page that changes is updated with the help of Virtual DOM. This significantly reduces the page load time, enhancing the app‚Äôs performance and giving a great user experience.

### 2. How is the Virtual DOM different from the Real DOM?

Virtual DOM is a lightweight Javascript object that is more like a skeletal representation of the Document Object Model(DOM), which is also known as the Real DOM. The virtual DOM, like the real DOM, comprises various nodes, which are actually the elements on the webpage. However, what makes it so light is the fact that it is just a set of nodes, and styling and JavaScript functionalities are not yet applied to it like the Real DOM. 


### 3. How is Virtual DOM enhancing performance?


# 4 Why Do We Use `key` in React?

## ‚úÖ Short Answer:
In React, we use the **`key`** prop to **uniquely identify elements** in a list so that React can **efficiently update the DOM** when the data changes.

Without a key, React doesn‚Äôt know which item changed, added, or removed. So it might re-render the entire list, which is slower and may cause bugs.

### 5. Is React a Library or a Framework

**React is a JavaScript library**, not a framework.
### üß† Why?

- It handles **only the UI (view layer)**.
- You can combine it with other tools for routing, state, etc.
- It offers **more flexibility** than a full framework.

###  6. What Features of React Place It Ahead in the Game?

### ‚úÖ Key Features of React:

- ‚öõÔ∏è **Component-Based**  
  UI is built using reusable, modular components.

- ‚ö° **Virtual DOM**  
  Faster rendering by updating only what changes.

- üîÅ **One-Way Data Binding**  
  Predictable data flow, easier to debug.

- üöÄ **Fast Performance**  
  Uses efficient algorithms for updates.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Rich Ecosystem**  
  Huge community, tools like Redux, React Router.

- üåç **Cross-Platform**  
  Use React Native for mobile apps.

- üéØ **JSX**  
  Combines HTML and JavaScript in one file for readable code.

  ### 7. Parent Component vs Child Component in React

### ‚úÖ Parent Component:
- A component that **contains** or **renders** other components.
- **Passes data** (props) to child components.
- Controls the layout or logic flow.

```jsx
function Parent() {
  return <Child name="John" />;
}
```
### 8. What is the Difference Between State and Props in React?

### ‚úÖ State:
- Used to **store data** that **changes** inside a component.
- **Managed within** the component using `useState`.
- Can **change over time** (e.g., on user interaction).

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### ‚úÖ Props:
Short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
Used to pass data from parent to child.
Read-only inside the child component.

### 9. What is the entry point of your react project?
In any react project, index.js is the most significant Javascript file in the entire application. It is the entry point of your React application. It imports all the necessary libraries like React, ReactDOM, and index.css. It also imports the App component from the App.js file that contains the application‚Äôs logic. Additionally, in this file, you can set any other configurations that might be needed in the application.

### 10. What is JSX? How do browsers read it?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It enables us to write HTML and Javascript together in React. While learning JSX can be slightly intimidating at the beginning, once you get the hang of it, it feels like a cakewalk. It makes the react code base much more simpler, elegant, and concise.

There is a catch! Browsers are not equipped to understand JSX. So, we need tools like Babel. Babel is a free, open-source Javascript compiler and transpiler. It converts modern JS and JSX into standard Javascript that can be understood across all browsers.

### 11. Why do we need to have keys in React?
Keys play a vital role when we are using list items. It serves as a unique identifier for each list element, helping React understand which item was modified and also optimizes the code.

### 12. What is prop drilling in React? What are its downsides?
Prop drilling in React is the method of passing data from a parent to its child components which ensures uni-directional flow of dataimage8
As the application grows in size, data passing via prop drilling can become more complicated. Say there is a parent component and has a child; the child also has a child, and it keeps going on. In this case, passing the data from the parent to the ‚Äònth‚Äô child component will become a major hassle.

To solve this problem, it is recommended that state management solutions, like context API, Redux, etc can be used. These solutions make sure that all the data is centralized in one place. This helps eliminate the need to pass the data as a prop from one component to another.


### 13. What is a render() in React? How many times does it get called?
Rendering is the process of converting the react code into an actual DOM representation that is displayed on the browser. This is done with the help of render() method. This method has a mandatory return statement inside it, which stores the entire UI of the page in the form of JSX.

The render() method is called when the page loads for the very first time, also known as the initial render, and subsequently every time the state of the component updates.

### 14. What is Conditional rendering in React?
Conditional rendering is the process of rendering a specific child component from the parent if it matches certain conditions. This can be done in React with the help of if/else statements, Switch Statements, ternary operators, IIFE(Immediately invoke functions), etc.

The following image shows components being conditionally rendered with the help of ternary operators.

###  15. What is useState() Hook?
The useState() Hook in React is a function in React version 16.8 that lets one add state to functional components.
It declares a state variable (taskName in this case). The value of the variable task name initially is undefined. Additionally, we can also assign some initial value to the variables like this ‚Äì

The second parameter is a function(setTaskName in this case) that is called when the value of the variable needs to be updated.

### 16.What is the use of react-router?
React comes with a library known as react-router that is used to create Single Page Web Applications. It helps define various routes within an application and renders different components in each route without refreshing the page.

### 17. What is a React Fragment?
To return multiple elements they have to be wrapped in a root element like a <div>. React Fragment is a feature in React that will help club all the elements inside one parent node. The bonus of using React Fragment is that it does not add any extra nodes to the DOM like <div>.

### 18. What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client, a widely used Javascript library that handles HTTP requests(network calls). It makes the process of sending and receiving data very effortless. It also transforms the received data to JSON automatically.

### 19. What is the use of React Developer Tools?
To return multiple elements they have to be wrapped in a root element like a <div>. React Fragment is a feature in React that will help club all the elements inside one parent node. The bonus of using React Fragment is that it does not add any extra nodes to the DOM like <div>.

### 20. What is the difference between Dependencies and Dev Dependencies?
Dependencies and devDependencies are packages that are present in the React project to help you create the React application. These dependencies can be found inside the package.json file in your React project.

### 21. What is Webpack?
Webpack is a powerful code bundler that converts all the files inside your React project, like JS files, CSS, images, assets, etc, into a single file for for sending to the browser. It automatically transpiles the code with the help of Bable, takes care of internal code splitting, and enables lazy loading of components. It also takes care of the optimization process by offering features like code minification, tree shaking, etc, that help bring down the size of the application, thereby improving the load time.

###  22. What is event handling in react? Give an example of handling form input.
Event Handling is basically how the app responds to user interaction. React efficiently handles various input events like mouse events(onClick, onMouseEnter, etc.), keyboard events(onKeyUp,onKeyDown, etc.), Form events(onChange, onSubmit, etc.), and many more.

### 23. What is the use of e.preventDefault()?
When working with forms in React, upon form submission, the general behavior of the browser is to reload the webpage. If you are trying to track the form data, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything on the console because of the page reload. To stop this, you can use e.preventDefault(). This helps in handling the form submission without reloading the page.

### 24. Different Between React-Redux and React Context API.
React-Redux is React‚Äôs state management library. It focuses on having a centralized state, also known as a redux store. It requires the setup of the store, reducers, actions, and middleware(if handling async calls). It is recommended for use in complex applications. React Context API is a built-in react feature, it helps in state sharing without the need to pass props from parent to child via prop drilling. It is great when having a small application as it requires minimal setup and no extra libraries to be installed.

### 25. What is a Callback function in React?
A callback function in React is a function that is passed to another function as an argument. This function is executed once the parent function has finished executing.

### 26. How can re-renders in React be prevented using shouldComponentUpdate()?


### 27. What is a dependency array?
Dependency array is a feature that comes with hooks. It is denoted as []. It helps in optimizing the application by rendering any particular component only when the specified value changes. If an empty dependency array is passed([]), it will execute the hook only once.

useEffect() will run on every render by default. But here, we have specified that it must run only when the value of ‚Äòcount‚Äô changes. 

Alternatively, if we want the hook to run on only once, we can send an empty array like this-

### 28. How to Optimise a React Application?
A React application can be optimized in various ways. Some of the ways to achieve the same are-

Use lazy loading for code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense.
Using IntersectionObserverAPI
Minimizing HTTP requests using concepts of Throttling and Debouncing
Using dependency array with useeffect() hook
Using useMemo() and useCallback() hooks
By implementing Treeshaking feature of webpack to reduce the bundle size
Using the concepts of Code Splitting and minification.
Using Pure components instead of class components wherever possible
Efficient implementation of the life cycle method  shouldComponentUpdate(), if following the class-based.


### 29. Server Side Rendering vs Client Side Rendering?

## In Server Side Rendering, when the user requests a website

A ready-to-be-rendered HTML response is built on the server along with JavaScript functionalities and is sent to the browser.
The browser renders the page which is now viewable (but not interactable).
Browser downloads and executes JS and React.
The page becomes fully interactable.

## In Client Side Rendering, when the user requests a website

The server sends an empty HTML file with JS links to the browser.
Browser downloads the HTML.
Browser then downloads CSS and JavaScript.

### 30. What can cause shouldComponentUpdate() to get into an infinite loop?
If we update the state inside shouldComponentUpdate(), it will always result in a re-render, which will, in turn, call the shouldComponentUpdate() method, and again, the state will be updated and, like this, get into an infinite loop and lead to crashing of the web page.

### 31. What problems are Hooks solving?
Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8. They help get rid of hefty class components and enable functional components to access the state. Hooks also help in writing minimal code to implement the same logic. For eg. We can use the useEffect() hook and implement both componentDidUpdate and shouldComponentUpdate life cycle methods without having to declare these two different lifecycle methods.

### 32. What is Mounting?
Mounting is the process of converting the virtual representation of a component into a final UI representation that is visible to users.

### 33. What are Pure Components in React?
Pure Components in React are functional components that prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

### 34. What happens in the lifecycle method componentWillUnmount()?
The lifecycle method componentWillUnmount() is used to take care of cleanup tasks. It is invoked just before the component is removed from the DOM. In this lifecycle method, tasks like ‚Äì canceling any existing timers, cleaning network requests, etc.

### 35. What is Next JS?
Next, JS is a full-blown React framework. It is open-source and used to create powerful web applications with ease. It handles Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). 


#### HOOKS : 

## useState()
Manages **state** in functional components.

## useEffect()
Performs side effects, like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

## useContext()
Accesses the context value in functional components.

## useReducer()
Manages complex state logic in functional components.

## useCallback()
Caches a function definition between renders to improve performance.

## useMemo()
Caches a value between renders to improve performance.

## useRef()
Creates a mutable reference to a value that persists across renders.

## useImperativeHandle()
Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref.

## useLayoutEffect()
Similar to useEffect(), but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering.
